| vii  | Replace "expose" with "exposure". | | |
| 23   | The `static double stats` method should return a `String`, not a `double`. | | Marlena Ames |
| 26   | Condition `if (x != 10 && y != 5) { y += 5; }` should be `if (x == 10 && y != 5) { y += 5; }`. | | Ty Rimedio |
| 41   | The `else if (b % 2 == 0)` case in the `pow` method should be:  
```java
else if (b % 2 == 0) {
    return pow(n * n, b / 2);
}
``` | | |
| 42   | The `else if (b % 2 == 0)` case in the `powTRHelper` method should be:  
```java
else if (b % 2 == 0) {
    return powTRHelper(n * n, b / 2, n * acc);
}
``` | | |
| 60   | Add the missing ending double quote: `"gafia"`. | | |
| 76   | Part (b) description should read: "Design the `isFactorionTR` tail recursive method, which solves the same problem as part (a), but uses tail recursion." | | Owen Harris |
| 79   | Exercise 2.44 should include a clause saying that methods to make the problem trivial, e.g., `Integer.parseInt`, are disallowed. | | Peter Perry |
| 136  | In Figure 3.9, the `add` method should instead say, "If `e` is not in `S`, it returns `true`; otherwise, it returns `false`." | | Dylan Waintraub |
| 140  | In Figure 3.10, the `size` method should instead say that it returns the number of logical elements in the "map" rather than "set". | | Dylan Waintraub |
| 148  | The code snippet of Example 3.40 should be as follows:  
```java
import java.util.ArrayDeque;
import java.util.Deque;
import java.util.Iterator;
import java.util.List;
import java.util.Stack;
          
class StackPrinter {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    List<Integer> L = List.of(10, 20, 30, 40, 50);
    Stack<Integer> S = new Stack<>();
    for (int x : L) { S.push(x); }
    
    // Enhanced for loop prints the stack elements "incorrectly!"
    // An Iterator also has this issue.
    // We get "10, 20, 30, 40, 50" separated by newlines.
    for (int x : S) { System.out.println(x); }
    
    Deque<Integer> D = new ArrayDeque<>();
    for (int x : L) { D.push(x); }
    // An ArrayDeque corrects this problem.
    // We correctly get "50, 40, 30, 20, 10" separated by newlines.
    for (int x : D) { System.out.println(x); }
  }
}

| 176  | The third example in Exercise 3.24 should have the 11 changed to a 1. The description should also change 1 + 4 + 4 = 9 to 4 + 1 + 4 = 9. | | Josh Rudnik |
| 185  | Exercise 3.65 should say, "In particular, we have a 2D array of strings whose first row contains column headers to a database. Examples of such columns may be 'ID', 'Name', 'Age', 'Salary', and so forth." The last sentence of the first paragraph should be removed as there is no context.  
 
In the second paragraph, change the last few words to "...returns the data from the rows that satisfy the criteria enforced by the command."  
 
Change the definition of a `Command` to `A Command is "SELECT <count> <header> WHERE <predicate>"`.  
 
Update the third paragraph to say "The `SELECT` command receives a `<count>` and a `<header>` to designate that the command should return n rows with data from the `<header>` column. An asterisk can be used to select all rows in the database." | | Germinari |
| 367  | Remove type parameters: `IBinarySearch search = new TailRecursiveBinarySearch();`. | | |
| 367  | The first two `assertEquals` semicolons should be changed to commas in the `assertAll(...)` block. | | |
| 390  | The last sentence of Example 7.4 should read, "Therefore, concluding that, in the average case, binary search runs in Î˜(lg n) time is incorrect." | | |
